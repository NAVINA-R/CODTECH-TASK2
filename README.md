Company : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

ID : CT08FHX

Domain : VLSI

Duration : December 20th,2024 to January 20th,2024

 TASK TWO:
 FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN

  Design FSMs using Verilog or VHDL in the VLSI software
 environment. Write testbenches to test different states and
 transitions of the FSM. Simulate the FSM behavior and verify its
 correctness

 MY WORK - Designing Moore's Machine using verilog

 ATTACHMENTS : design.sv , testbench.sv ,outputs

 Working:

 FSM Design:
The FSM has three states: IDLE, LOAD, and PROCESS.
State transitions depend on the input signal in.
The output out is determined by the current state (Moore machine).

Testbench:
Generates clock and reset signals.
Simulates various inputs to test transitions and FSM behavior.
Monitors signals and displays the state and outputs during simulation.
